## Training app for Android
This is a simple and minimalistic training app including my own training routine that helps alleviate my back pain.
Routine consist of two alternating workouts. Some exercises repeat and some are different to accomodate muscle recovery time.
After every workout you select which exercises remain on the same difficulty in the next session and in which to increase weight.

## Storing data
App uses Room Persistence Library to store history of workouts and progression.

## Motivation
I'm learning programming in java/android and this app is my first project.
